# Overview

I wanted to recreate my Number Guessing Game that I made in Java, in Kotlin.

This program is supposed to prompt the user to enter a number between 0 and 100.
It keeps going until the user guessing the number correctly that was randomly generated.

The reason I wanted to recreate this game I made in Java, in Kotlin, is so that I could compare Java and Kotlin using two programs I wrote. Unfortunately, I was having complications with VS Code no matter how I went about writing my code, how many Kotlin extensions I downloaded, nothing seemed to be working well.

# Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code
- Kotlin Programming Language
- Git & GitHub

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

- Figure out why my code isn't wanting to work on VS Code
- Add some fun features I've learned that could work with this program such as multiple difficulties
- Possibly figure out how to turn this into a fun little mobile game
